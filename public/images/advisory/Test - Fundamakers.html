                            <br>Question No 1<b><p>The passage below is accompanied by a set of six 
    questions. Choose the best answer to each question</p>

<p>When we consider great painters of the past, the study of art and the study of illusion cannot always be separated. By 
illusion I one season to the next instead of melting away. Each time, the enormous ice sheets resulting from this continual
buildup lasted tens of thousands of years until the end of each particular glacial cycle brought a warmer climate. 
Scientists speculated that these glacial cycles were ultimately driven by astronomical factors: slow, cyclic changes
in the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit and in the tilt and orientation of its spin axis. But up until around 30 years 
ago, the lack of an independent record of ice-age timing made the hypothesis untestable.</p>

<p>Then in the early 1950’s Emiliani produced the first complete record of the waxings and wanings of past glaciations. 
It came from a seemingly odd place, the seafloor. Single-cell marine organisms called “foraminifera” house themselves
in shells made from calcium carbonate. When the foraminifera die, sink to the bottom, and become part of seafloor 
sediments, the carbonate of their shells preserves certain characteristics of the seawater they inhabited. In particular,
the ratio of a heavy isotope of oxygen (oxygen-18) to ordinary oxygen (oxygen-16) in the carbonate preserves the ratio of
the two oxygens in water molecules.</p>

<p>It is now understood that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in seawater closely reflects the proportion of the world’s 
water locked up in glaciers and ice sheets. A kind of meteorological distillation accounts for the link. Water 
molecules containing the heavier isotope tend to condense and fall as precipitation slightly sooner than molecules
containing the lighter isotope. Hence, as water vapor evaporated from warm oceans moves away from its source, its
oxygen-18 returns more quickly to the oceans than does its oxygen-16. What falls as snow on distant ice sheets and
mountain glaciers is relatively depleted of oxygen-18. As the oxygen-18-poor ice builds up, the oceans become 
relatively enriched in the isotope. The larger the ice sheets grow, the higher the proportion of oxygen-18 becomes
in seawater—and hence in the sediments.</p>

<p>Analyzing cores drilled from seafloor sediments, Emiliani found that the isotopic ratio rose and fell in rough
accord with the Earth’s astronomical cycles. Since that pioneering observation, oxygen-isotope measurements have 
been made on hundreds of cores. A chronology for the combined record enables scientists to show that the record 
contains the very same periodicities as the orbital processes. Over the past 800,000 years, the global ice volume
has peaked every 100,000 years, matching the period of the orbital eccentricity variation. In addition, “wrinkles”
superposed on each cycle—small decreases or surges in ice volume—have come at intervals of roughly 23,000 and 
41,000 years, in keeping with the precession and tilt frequencies of the Earth’s spin axis.</p></b><br><p>Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?</p>

containing the lighter isotope. Hence, as water vapor evaporated from warm oceans moves away from its source, its
oxygen-18 returns more quickly to the oceans than does its oxygen-16. What falls as snow on distant ice sheets and
mountain glaciers is relatively depleted of oxygen-18. As the oxygen-18-poor ice builds up, the oceans become

contains the very same periodicities as the orbital processes. Over the past 800,000 years, the global ice volume
has peaked every 100,000 years, matching the period of the orbital eccentricity variation. In addition, “wrinkles”

contains the very same periodicities as the orbital processes. Over the past 800,000 years, the global ice volume
has peaked every 100,000 years, matching the period of the orbital eccentricity variation. In addition, “wrinkles”

41,000 years, in keeping with the precession and tilt frequencies of the Earth’s spin axis.</p></b><br>	<p>The passage suggests that the scientists who first constructed a coherent, continuous picture of past

<p>When we consider great painters of the past, the study of art and the study of illusion cannot always be separated. By 
illusion I one season to the next instead of melting away. Each time, the enormous ice sheets resulting from this continual
buildup lasted tens of thousands of years until the end of each particular glacial cycle brought a warmer climate. 
Scientists speculated that these glacial cycles were ultimately driven by astronomical factors: slow, cyclic changes
in the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit and in the tilt and orientation of its spin axis. But up until around 30 years 
ago, the lack of an independent record of ice-age timing made the hypothesis untestable.</p>

<p>Then in the early 1950’s Emiliani produced the first complete record of the waxings and wanings of past glaciations. 
It came from a seemingly odd place, the seafloor. Single-cell marine organisms called “foraminifera” house themselves
in shells made from calcium carbonate. When the foraminifera die, sink to the bottom, and become part of seafloor 
sediments, the carbonate of their shells preserves certain characteristics of the seawater they inhabited. In particular,
the ratio of a heavy isotope of oxygen (oxygen-18) to ordinary oxygen (oxygen-16) in the carbonate preserves the ratio of
the two oxygens in water molecules.</p>

<p>It is now understood that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in seawater closely reflects the proportion of the world’s 
water locked up in glaciers and ice sheets. A kind of meteorological distillation accounts for the link. Water 
molecules containing the heavier isotope tend to condense and fall as precipitation slightly sooner than molecules
containing the lighter isotope. Hence, as water vapor evaporated from warm oceans moves away from its source, its
oxygen-18 returns more quickly to the oceans than does its oxygen-16. What falls as snow on distant ice sheets and
mountain glaciers is relatively depleted of oxygen-18. As the oxygen-18-poor ice builds up, the oceans become 
relatively enriched in the isotope. The larger the ice sheets grow, the higher the proportion of oxygen-18 becomes
in seawater—and hence in the sediments.</p>

<p>Analyzing cores drilled from seafloor sediments, Emiliani found that the isotopic ratio rose and fell in rough
accord with the Earth’s astronomical cycles. Since that pioneering observation, oxygen-isotope measurements have 
been made on hundreds of cores. A chronology for the combined record enables scientists to show that the record 
contains the very same periodicities as the orbital processes. Over the past 800,000 years, the global ice volume
has peaked every 100,000 years, matching the period of the orbital eccentricity variation. In addition, “wrinkles”

                            <br>Question No 7<b><p>The passage below is accompanied by a set of six questions. Choose the 
best answer to each question</p>

<p>Women’s participation in the revolutionary events in France between 1789 and 1795 has only recently been given nuanced 
    treatment. Early twentieth century historians of the French Revolution are typified by Jaures, who, though sympathetic 
    to the women’s movement of his own time, never even mentions its antecedents in revolutionary France. Even today most 
    general histories treat only cursorily a few individual women, like Marie Antoinette. The recent studies by Landes, 
    Badinter, Godineau, and Roudinesco, however, should signal a much-needed reassessment of women’s participation.</p>

<p>Godineau and Roudinesco point to three significant phases in that participation. The first, up to mid-1792, involved those 
    women who wrote political tracts. Typical of their orientation to theoretical issues—in Godineaus’s view, without practical
    effect—is Marie Gouze’s Declaration of the Right of Women. The emergence of vocal middle class women’s political clubs marks 
    the second phase. Formed in 1791 as adjuncts of middle-class male political clubs, and originally philanthropic in function,
    by late 1792 independent clubs of women began to advocate military participation for women. In the final phase, the famine of
    1795 occasioned a mass women’s movement: women seized food supplies, hold officials hostage, and argued for the implementation
    of democratic politics. This phase ended in May of 1795 with the military suppression of this multiclass movement. In all 
    three phases women’s participation in politics contrasted markedly with their participation before 1789. Before that date 
    some noblewomen participated indirectly in elections, but such participation by more than a narrow range of the 
    population—women or men—came only with the Revolution.</p>
    
<p>What makes the recent studies particularly compelling, however, is not so much their organization of chronology 
    as their unflinching willingness to confront the reasons for the collapse of the women’s movement. For Landes and
    Badinter, the necessity of women’s having to speak in the established vocabularies of certain intellectual and political
    tradition diminished the ability of the women’s movement to resist suppression. Many women, and many men, they argue, 
    located their vision within the confining tradition of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who linked male and female roles with public
    and private spheres respectively. But, when women went on to make political alliances with radical Jacobinmen, Badinter 
    asserts, they adopted a vocabulary and a violently extremist viewpoint that unfortunately was even more damaging to their 
    political interests.</p>
    
<p>Each of these scholars has different political agenda and takes a different approach—Godineau, for example, works with 
    police archives while Roudinesco uses explanatory schema from modern psychology. Yet, admirably, each gives center stage 
    to a group that previously has been marginalized, or at best undifferentiated, by historians. And in the case of Landes
    and Badinter, the reader is left with a sobering awareness of the cost to the women of the revolution of speaking in 
    borrowed voices. </p></b><br><p>Which one of the following best states the main point of the

                            <br>Question No 9<b><p>The passage below is accompanied by a set of six questions. Choose the 
best answer to each question</p>

<p>Women’s participation in the revolutionary events in France between 1789 and 1795 has only recently been given nuanced 
    treatment. Early twentieth century historians of the French Revolution are typified by Jaures, who, though sympathetic 
    to the women’s movement of his own time, never even mentions its antecedents in revolutionary France. Even today most 
    general histories treat only cursorily a few individual women, like Marie Antoinette. The recent studies by Landes, 
    Badinter, Godineau, and Roudinesco, however, should signal a much-needed reassessment of women’s participation.</p>

<p>Godineau and Roudinesco point to three significant phases in that participation. The first, up to mid-1792, involved those 
    women who wrote political tracts. Typical of their orientation to theoretical issues—in Godineaus’s view, without practical
    effect—is Marie Gouze’s Declaration of the Right of Women. The emergence of vocal middle class women’s political clubs marks 
    the second phase. Formed in 1791 as adjuncts of middle-class male political clubs, and originally philanthropic in function,
    by late 1792 independent clubs of women began to advocate military participation for women. In the final phase, the famine of
    1795 occasioned a mass women’s movement: women seized food supplies, hold officials hostage, and argued for the implementation
    of democratic politics. This phase ended in May of 1795 with the military suppression of this multiclass movement. In all 
    three phases women’s participation in politics contrasted markedly with their participation before 1789. Before that date 
    some noblewomen participated indirectly in elections, but such participation by more than a narrow range of the 
    population—women or men—came only with the Revolution.</p>
    
<p>What makes the recent studies particularly compelling, however, is not so much their organization of chronology 
    as their unflinching willingness to confront the reasons for the collapse of the women’s movement. For Landes and
    Badinter, the necessity of women’s having to speak in the established vocabularies of certain intellectual and political
    tradition diminished the ability of the women’s movement to resist suppression. Many women, and many men, they argue, 
    located their vision within the confining tradition of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who linked male and female roles with public
    and private spheres respectively. But, when women went on to make political alliances with radical Jacobinmen, Badinter 
    asserts, they adopted a vocabulary and a violently extremist viewpoint that unfortunately was even more damaging to their 
    political interests.</p>
    
<p>Each of these scholars has different political agenda and takes a different approach—Godineau, for example, works with 
    police archives while Roudinesco uses explanatory schema from modern psychology. Yet, admirably, each gives center stage 
    to a group that previously has been marginalized, or at best undifferentiated, by historians. And in the case of Landes
    and Badinter, the reader is left with a sobering awareness of the cost to the women of the revolution of speaking in 
    borrowed voices. </p></b><br>	<p>According to the passage, which one of the following is a true

                            <br>Question No 12<b><p>The passage below is accompanied by a set of six questions. Choose the 
best answer to each question</p>

<p>Women’s participation in the revolutionary events in France between 1789 and 1795 has only recently been given nuanced 
    treatment. Early twentieth century historians of the French Revolution are typified by Jaures, who, though sympathetic 
    to the women’s movement of his own time, never even mentions its antecedents in revolutionary France. Even today most 
    general histories treat only cursorily a few individual women, like Marie Antoinette. The recent studies by Landes, 
    Badinter, Godineau, and Roudinesco, however, should signal a much-needed reassessment of women’s participation.</p>

<p>Godineau and Roudinesco point to three significant phases in that participation. The first, up to mid-1792, involved those 
    women who wrote political tracts. Typical of their orientation to theoretical issues—in Godineaus’s view, without practical
    effect—is Marie Gouze’s Declaration of the Right of Women. The emergence of vocal middle class women’s political clubs marks 
    the second phase. Formed in 1791 as adjuncts of middle-class male political clubs, and originally philanthropic in function,
    by late 1792 independent clubs of women began to advocate military participation for women. In the final phase, the famine of
    1795 occasioned a mass women’s movement: women seized food supplies, hold officials hostage, and argued for the implementation
    of democratic politics. This phase ended in May of 1795 with the military suppression of this multiclass movement. In all 
    three phases women’s participation in politics contrasted markedly with their participation before 1789. Before that date 
    some noblewomen participated indirectly in elections, but such participation by more than a narrow range of the 
    population—women or men—came only with the Revolution.</p>
    
<p>What makes the recent studies particularly compelling, however, is not so much their organization of chronology 
    as their unflinching willingness to confront the reasons for the collapse of the women’s movement. For Landes and
    Badinter, the necessity of women’s having to speak in the established vocabularies of certain intellectual and political
    tradition diminished the ability of the women’s movement to resist suppression. Many women, and many men, they argue, 
    located their vision within the confining tradition of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who linked male and female roles with public
    and private spheres respectively. But, when women went on to make political alliances with radical Jacobinmen, Badinter 
    asserts, they adopted a vocabulary and a violently extremist viewpoint that unfortunately was even more damaging to their 
    political interests.</p>
    
<p>Each of these scholars has different political agenda and takes a different approach—Godineau, for example, works with 
    police archives while Roudinesco uses explanatory schema from modern psychology. Yet, admirably, each gives center stage 
    to a group that previously has been marginalized, or at best undifferentiated, by historians. And in the case of Landes
    and Badinter, the reader is left with a sobering awareness of the cost to the women of the revolution of speaking in 
    borrowed voices. </p></b><br>	<p>The author of the passage is primarily concerned with</p>

                            <br>Question No 13<b><p>The passage below is accompanied by a set of six questions. Choose the
best answer to each question</p>

<p>Joseph Glatthaar’s Forged in Battle is not the first excellent study of
Black soldiers and their White officers in the Civil War, but it uses 
more soldiers’ letters and diaries—including rare material from Black 
soldiers—and concentrates more intensely on Black-White relations in 
Black regiments than do any of its predecessors. Glatthaar’s title 
expresses his thesis: loyalty, friendship, and respect among White 
officers and Black soldiers were fostered by the mutual dangers they
faced in combat.</p>

<p>Glatthaar accurately describes the government’s discriminatory treatment
of Black soldiers in pay, promotion, medical care, and job assignments,
appropriately emphasizing the campaign by Black soldiers and their 
officers to get the opportunity to fight. That chance remained limited
throughout the war by army policies that kept most Black units serving 
in rear-echelon assignments and working in labor battalions. Thus, while
their combat death rate was only one-third that of White units, their 
mortality rate from disease, a major killer in his war, was twice as 
great. Despite these obstacles, the courage and effectiveness of several
Black units in combat won increasing respect from initially skeptical 
or hostile White soldiers. As one White officer put it, “they have 
fought their way into the respect of all the army.”</p>

<p>In trying to demonstrate the magnitude of this attitudinal change, 
however, Glatthaar seems to exaggerate the prewar racism of the White 
men who became officers in Black regiments. “Prior to the war,” he writes
of these men, “virtually all of them held powerful racial prejudices.” 
While perhaps true of those officers who joined Black units for promotion
or other self-serving motives, this statement misrepresents the attitudes
of the many abolitionists who became officers in Black regiments. Having
spent years fighting against the race prejudice endemic in American 
society, they participated eagerly in this military experiment, which
they hoped would help African Americans achieve freedom and postwar 
civil equality. By current standards of racial egalitarianism, these 
men’s paternalism toward African Americans was racist. But to call 
their feelings “powerful racial prejudices” is to indulge in generational
chauvinism—to judge past eras by present standards.</p></b><br><p>According to the author, which of the following is true of Glatthaar’s Forged in Battle compared with previous
    studies on the same topic?</p>

                            <br>Question No 15<b><p>The passage below is accompanied by a set of six questions. Choose the
best answer to each question</p>

<p>Joseph Glatthaar’s Forged in Battle is not the first excellent study of
Black soldiers and their White officers in the Civil War, but it uses 
more soldiers’ letters and diaries—including rare material from Black 
soldiers—and concentrates more intensely on Black-White relations in 
Black regiments than do any of its predecessors. Glatthaar’s title 
expresses his thesis: loyalty, friendship, and respect among White 
officers and Black soldiers were fostered by the mutual dangers they
faced in combat.</p>

<p>Glatthaar accurately describes the government’s discriminatory treatment
of Black soldiers in pay, promotion, medical care, and job assignments,
appropriately emphasizing the campaign by Black soldiers and their 
officers to get the opportunity to fight. That chance remained limited
throughout the war by army policies that kept most Black units serving 
in rear-echelon assignments and working in labor battalions. Thus, while
their combat death rate was only one-third that of White units, their 
mortality rate from disease, a major killer in his war, was twice as 
great. Despite these obstacles, the courage and effectiveness of several
Black units in combat won increasing respect from initially skeptical 
or hostile White soldiers. As one White officer put it, “they have 
fought their way into the respect of all the army.”</p>

<p>In trying to demonstrate the magnitude of this attitudinal change, 
however, Glatthaar seems to exaggerate the prewar racism of the White 
men who became officers in Black regiments. “Prior to the war,” he writes
of these men, “virtually all of them held powerful racial prejudices.” 
While perhaps true of those officers who joined Black units for promotion
or other self-serving motives, this statement misrepresents the attitudes
of the many abolitionists who became officers in Black regiments. Having
spent years fighting against the race prejudice endemic in American 
society, they participated eagerly in this military experiment, which
they hoped would help African Americans achieve freedom and postwar 
civil equality. By current standards of racial egalitarianism, these 
men’s paternalism toward African Americans was racist. But to call 
their feelings “powerful racial prejudices” is to indulge in generational
chauvinism—to judge past eras by present standards.</p></b><br>	<p>The passage mentions which of the following as an important 
theme that receives special emphasis in Glatthaar’s book?</p>

<p>According to a recent theory, Archean-age gold-quartz vein systems were
formed over two billion years ago from magnetic fluids that originated 
from molten granite-like bodies deep beneath the surface of the Earth. 
This theory is contrary to the widely held view that the systems were 
deposited from metamorphic fluids, that is, from fluids that formed 
during the dehydration of wet sedimentary rocks.</p>

<p>The recently developed theory has considerable practical importance. 
Most of the gold deposits discovered during the original gold rushes
were exposed at the Earth’s surface and were found because they had 
shed trails of alluvial gold that were easily traced by simple 
prospecting methods. Although these same methods still lead to an
occasional discovery, most deposits not yet discovered have gone 
undetected because they are buried and have no surface expression.</p>

<p>The challenge in exploration is therefore to unravel the subsurface 
geology of an area and pinpoint the position of buried minerals. Methods
widely used today include analysis of aerial images that yield a broad 
geological overview; geophysical techniques that provide data on the 
magnetic, electrical, and mineralogical properties of the rocks being 
investigated; and sensitive chemical tests that are able to detect the 
subtle chemical halos that often envelop mineralization. However, none
of these high-technology methods are of any value if the sites to which

                            <br>Question No 22<b><p>The passage below is accompanied by a set of three questions. Choose the 
best answer to each question</p>

<p>Currently, legal scholars agree that in some cases legal rules do not 
specify a definite outcome. These scholars believe that such 
indeterminacy results from the vagueness of language: the boundaries 
of the application of a term are often unclear. Nevertheless, they 
maintain that the system of legal rules by and large rests on clear core
meanings that do determine definite outcomes for most cases. Contrary to
this view, an earlier group of legal philosophers, called “realists,” 
argued that indeterminacy pervades every part of the law.</p>

<p>The realists held that there is always a cluster of rules relevant to 
the decision in any litigated case. For example, deciding whether an 
aunt’s promise to pay her niece a sum of money if she refrained from 
smoking is enforceable would involve a number of rules regarding such
issues as offer, acceptance, and revocation. Linguistic vagueness in 
any one of these rules would affect the outcome of the case, making 
possible multiple points of indeterminacy, not just one or two, in any
legal case.</p>

<p>For the realists, an even more damaging kind of indeterminacy stems from 
the fact that in a common-law system based on precedent, a judge’s 
decision is held to be binding on judges in subsequent similar cases.
Judicial decisions are expressed in written opinions, commonly held to
consist of two parts: the holding (the decision for or against the 
plaintiff and the essential grounds or legal reasons for it, that is,
what subsequent judges are bound by), and the dicta (everything in an
opinion not essential to the decision, for example, comments about 
points of law not treated as the basis of the outcome). The realists
argued that in practice the common-law system treats the “holding/dicta” 
distinction loosely. They pointed out that even when the judge writing 
an opinion characterizes part of it as “the holding,” judges writing 
subsequent opinions, although unlikely to dispute the decision itself,
are not bound by the original judge’s perception of what was essential
to the decision. Later judges have tremendous leeway in being able to 
redefine the holding and the dicta in a precedential case. This leeway
enables judges to choose which rules of law formed the basis of the 
decision in the earlier case. When judging almost any case, then, a 
judge can find a relevant precedential case which, in subsequent 
opinions, has been read by one judge as stating one legal rule, and 
by another judge as stating another, possibly contradictory one. A 
judge thus faces an indeterminate legal situation in which he or she
has to choose which rules are to govern the case at hand.</p></b><br><p>According to the passage, the realists argued that which one of
the following is true of a common-law system?</p>

<p>About 36 million years ago, an asteroid slammed into Canada and
created a fake diamond, which over the millennia degraded and transformed 
into a shiny black rock. Now, geologists have used that gem to confirm 
a new temperature record for the Earth’s surface: 2370 degrees 
Celsius.__________</p>

That's how the popular planet-inventing Twitter bot Newfound Planets ,
might describe this particular gaseous giant, smashing together verbs 
and adjectives into a delicious galactic treat that has to be too good 
to be true.WASP-12b is a burning monster of a world, a ‘Hot Jupiter’ 
orbiting a star 1400 light-years away. Scientists first discovered 
the planet back in 2008, but recent observations made with the Hubble
Space Telescope show that the planet is very unusual.______________<p></p>

<p>Handwriting analysis—also known as graphology—is a poor way to predict
personality types, even though it is used by 3,000 United States firms

of forty professionals.</p>
Which one of the following is an assumption necessary to the argument?

<p>You are given a list with N distinct positive integers: 
A[1], A[2], . . . , A[N]. A subset of these is said to be 
Good if all their indices have different remainders when 
divided by 5. In other words, consider a subset

there are no x and y such that A[x] and A[y] have been

divide x by 5 is the same as the remainder you get

a Good subset cannot include both A[9] and A[24] because 
both 9 and 24 have remainder 4 when divided by 5.</p>

<p>You are given a list with N distinct positive integers: 
A[1], A[2], . . . , A[N]. A subset of these is said to be 
Good if all their indices have different remainders when 
divided by 5. In other words, consider a subset 
{A[i1], A[i2], . . . , A[ik]}. This is Good, if
there are no x and y such that A[x] and A[y] have been 
selected to be in the subset, and the remainder when you 
divide x by 5 is the same as the remainder you get
when you divide y by 5.</p>

<p>For instance, if the list has 30 elements A[1] to A[30],
a Good subset cannot include both A[9] and A[24] because 
both 9 and 24 have remainder 4 when divided by 5.</p>
<p>The Score of a subset is the sum of the values in it. 
You are given an integer K,and you should find a Good subset
of size at most K whose Score is maximized.</p>

P1 can fill the tank in 8 hr while P2 can fill the tank in 12 hr. There 
is a pipe P3 which can empty the tank in 8 hr. Both the pumps are opened 
simultaneously. The supervisor of the tank, before going out on a work,
sets a timer to open P3 when the tank is half filled so that the tank is 
exactly filled up by the time he is back. Due to technical fault P3 opens
